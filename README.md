# 🚀 LED Chaser Circuit – Custom PCB

This project is a **custom PCB design** for a classic **LED Chaser circuit**, built using the **IC 555 Timer** and **CD4017 Decade Counter**, designed entirely in **KiCad**.

The LED chaser is a simple yet fun electronics project that lights up LEDs sequentially, creating a “running light” effect — commonly seen in decorations and light displays.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **IC 555** – Generates the clock pulses in astable mode  
- **CD4017** – Decodes and drives 10 LEDs sequentially based on the clock signal  
- **Potentiometer** – Adjusts the speed of the chasing effect  
- **Vias + Back Routing** – Used for making several back-layer connections; though a bit tedious, it made the PCB layout much cleaner and more compact

## 🛠️ What I Created

- ✅ **Schematic Diagram** – Complete circuit connections in KiCad  
- ✅ **PCB Layout** – Fully routed in KiCad PCB Editor  
- ✅ **3D Model** – Realistic preview of the PCB before fabrication
